# React Fundamentals - Day 2

## Overview

In the second day of this course, students receive an introduction to Node.js, and learn to geenrate React applications utlizing the create-react-app package. Students then deep dive into working with React Component architecture, and learn how to build reactive, stateful components utilizing React Props, State, and class methods.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain what Node.js is and how to access the npm registry
* Utilize create-react-app to quickly generate new React application templates
* Understand how to interact with props and state in a React component

## Suggested Pacing

This is a *rough* estimation on how long to spend on topics, but will be adjusted to the needs of the classroom!
