# Exercise: Working with Forms

## Instructions

- Using the `src` folder as a starting point, code the `src/SignUpForm.js` file to use controlled components for each input. 

- Click the submit button to log the state to the console and check your progress.

- Once all the inputs have been converted to controlled components, try adding a new element to the `render` function below the form that will display the data from the state in real time.
