# Exercise: Working with Functions - Built in Methods

Let's take a look at how we can interact with the "instance methods" our data inherits from its prototype.

## Part 1: String Methods

Given the following string:

``` js
const favoriteHero = 'Spider-Man '
```

How would you...

- Return the number of characters the string contains?

- Return the string without the trailing whitespace (`' '`)?

- Return the string with all capital letters? Lower case letters?

- Return just the third character in the string (`i`)?

## Part 2: Array Methods

Given the following array:

``` js
const numArr = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
```

How would you...

- Return the array with only including numbers > `15`?

- Return the array with +1 to each number (`[5, 9, 16, 17, 24, 43]`)?

- Return the index of the number `23`?


- How are the `.pop()`, `.push()`, `.sort()`, and `.splice()` methods different than `.filter()`, `.map()`, and `.slice()`? *Read MDN descriptions!*
