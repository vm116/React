# Exercise: Variables, Types, and Template Literals

## Instructions

### Part 1

- Create a variable that cannot be reassigned called `name` and assign it a string value of your name (`name = 'Tim`).

- Create a variable that can be reassigned called `age` and assign it a number value of your age (`age = 28`).

- Create a variable that can be reassigned called `jobTitle` and assign it to a string value of your job title.

- Create a variable that can be reassigned called `aboutMe` and assign it to the string `My name is [name], I am [age] years old and my current job is [jobTitle]` using teplate literal syntax.

- Log the value of `aboutMe` to the console. Look good?

### Part 2

- It's your birthday! Update your `age` to reflect your age + 1.

- You've been promoted! Update your `jobTitle` to reflect your new role (you choose).

- Log the value of `aboutMe` to the console again. Still look correct?

- Reassign the value of `aboutMe` to match your new age and job title.

- Log the updated value of `aboutMe` to the console.
